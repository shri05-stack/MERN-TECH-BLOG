Hi folks, this website i created for fun. 
It is a tech blog website which i made using react, tailwindcss, mongoDB, node, express and redux. 
User can signup and login and start creating blogs, read blogs without sig in but can't like and comment . 
User have to log in before commenting and liking a post. 
I have categorized all set of technical blogs, like Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning , cloud computing etc.
User can upload images as well. 
Once user open a certain type of blog, they can see related blogs from that type. 
One more thing i have integrated firebase for safe login and OAuth.

I have kept it open source as well, if you see any error or make and changes , please go ahead.
